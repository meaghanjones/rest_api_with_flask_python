What is a web server?
- a piece of software designed to accept incoming web requests (for example, google has many webservers, when we go to http://google.com we are sending something to a webserver, and the webserver can decided to respond back)

What do we send?
- get / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.google.com (This is what is called a get request)
- Get is called a verb and it tells the server to some extent what is expected of the server
- / is the path
- HTTP (is a protocol)

So, what?
- That's it!
- the server sees that, and then there's code
- the code may interpret the GET request in different ways
  - it may give you an error, if / is not found
  - it may give you an error if HTTP is not supported
  - it may give you an error if the server is unavailable
  - it may give you HTML code back (which is what it normally does)
  - it may give you some text back
  - it may give you nothing back

Differences
- the only difference is what teh server responds with
- for example Twitter will resond with teh Twitter HTML
- google will respod with the Google HTML

What else?
- going to a page will always do a GET request
- but there are many other things we can do such as POST, PUT, OPTIONS, HEAD and much more!
- each server responds differently to each, but usually have the same meaning in each

get: retrieve something
post: receive data and use it (maybe a peice of json - and then an item would be created - presumably)
put: make something is there (update an item/ or create the chair if it's not there)
delete: remove something

(these are the 4 most important HTTP verbs - there are many others but these are the only ones used in this course)
